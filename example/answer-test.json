            "137Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional  judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: \u2022  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion",
            "Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  \u2022\t Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \u2022\t Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit",
            "In our opinion the accompanying financial statements give a true and  fair view of the financial position of the Group and the Company at 31 December 2021 and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act, 2015.   Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the  Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial  statements  section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Kenya. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion",
            "The directors accept responsibility for the preparation and presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting  Standards and in the manner required by the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015. They also accept responsibility for:  i)  Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control as they determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free  from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; ii) Selecting suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; and  iii) Making judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances Having assessed the Group\u2019s and Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, the directors are not aware of any material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast doubt upon the Group\u2019s and Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.
